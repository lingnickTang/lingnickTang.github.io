### Exercises

#### Job control

1.From what we have seen, we can use some `ps aux | grep` commands to get our jobs’ pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a `sleep 10000` job in a terminal, background it with `Ctrl-Z` and continue its execution with `bg`. Now use [`pgrep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find its pid and [`pkill`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the `-af` flags).

   ```sh
   pgrep -a sleep
   pkill -f 10000(# or pkill -f sleep)
   ```

   

2.Say you don’t want to start a process until another completes, how you would go about it? In this exercise our limiting process will always be `sleep 60 &`. One way to achieve this is to use the [`wait`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wait.1p.html) command. Try launching the sleep command and having an `ls` wait until the background process finishes.

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   sleep 10 &
   PID=$!
   wait $PID
   ls
   ```
   
   However, this strategy will fail if we start in a different bash session, since `wait` only works for child processes. One feature we did not discuss in the notes is that the `kill` command’s exit status will be zero on success and nonzero otherwise. `kill -0` does not send a signal but will give a nonzero exit status if the process does not exist. Write a bash function called `pidwait` that takes a pid and waits until the given process completes. You should use `sleep` to avoid wasting CPU unnecessarily.
   
   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   sleep 10 &
   while true
   do
   	kill -0 $PID
   	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   		echo "breaking!"
   		break
   	fi
   	sleep 1
   done
   ls
   ```
   
   

#### Terminal multiplexer

1.Follow this `tmux` [tutorial](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) and then learn how to do some basic customizations following [these steps](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/).

   ```sh
   #amazing
   ```

   

#### Aliases

1.Create an alias `dc` that resolves to `cd` for when you type it wrongly.

   ```sh
   alias dc=cd
   ```

   

2.Run `history | awk '{$1="";print substr($0,2)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10` to get your top 10 most used commands and consider writing shorter aliases for them. Note: this works for Bash; if you’re using ZSH, use `history 1` instead of just `history`.

   ```sh
   # the top 10 of my used commands
   	  5 ps
         7 cd Desktop
        10 vi ~/.spacevim
        11 cd ~
        11 sh ./pidwait
        12 vi input.txt
        16 vi pidwait
        17 vi .vimrc
        25 vi ~/.vimrc  ->  v
        47 ls
   
   ```

   

#### Dotfiles

Let’s get you up to speed with dotfiles.

1.Create a folder for your dotfiles and set up version control.

2.Add a configuration for at least one program, e.g. your shell, with some customization (to start off, it can be something as simple as customizing your shell prompt by setting `$PS1`).

3.Set up a method to install your dotfiles quickly (and without manual effort) on a new machine. This can be as simple as a shell script that calls `ln -s` for each file, or you could use a [specialized utility](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/).

   ```sh
   #be careful that the original dotfiles in home will be 
   #overwritten, make backups before execute this file
   #!bin/bash
   link() {
   	from="$1"
   	to="$2"
   	echo "Linking '$from' to '$to'"
   	rm -f "$to"
   	ln -s $from $to
   }
   
   curPath=$(dirname $(readlink -f "$0"))
   echo $curPath 
   
   ignore='install.sh'
   for file in $(ls $curPath); do
   	if [[ $file = $ignore ]]; then
   		continue
   	fi
   	src=$curPath'/'$file
   	obj=$HOME'/.'$file  
   	link $src $obj
   done
   
   ```

   

4.Test your installation script on a fresh virtual machine.

5.Migrate all of your current tool configurations to your dotfiles repository.

6.Publish your dotfiles on GitHub.



#### Remote Machines

Install a Linux virtual machine (or use an already existing one) for this exercise. If you are not familiar with virtual machines check out [this](https://hibbard.eu/install-ubuntu-virtual-box/) tutorial for installing one.

1.Go to `~/.ssh/` and check if you have a pair of SSH keys there. If not, generate them with `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519`. It is recommended that you use a password and use `ssh-agent` , more info [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent).
2.Edit `.ssh/config` to have an entry as follows

```
Host vm
    User username_goes_here
    HostName ip_goes_here
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
```

1.Use `ssh-copy-id vm` to copy your ssh key to the server.

   ```sh
   #copy the ssh key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   

2.Start a webserver in your VM by executing `python -m http.server 8888`. Access the VM webserver by navigating to `http://localhost:9999` in your machine.

3.Edit your SSH server config by doing `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and disable password authentication by editing the value of `PasswordAuthentication`. Disable root login by editing the value of `PermitRootLogin`. Restart the `ssh` service with `sudo service sshd restart`. Try sshing in again.

4.(Challenge) Install [`mosh`](https://mosh.org/) in the VM and establish a connection. Then disconnect the network adapter of the server/VM. Can mosh properly recover from it?

5.(Challenge) Look into what the `-N` and `-f` flags do in `ssh` and figure out what a command to achieve background port forwarding.

   ```sh
   #check the -L flag
   ```
