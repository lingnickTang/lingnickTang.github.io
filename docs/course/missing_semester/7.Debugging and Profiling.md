## Debugging and Profiling

> 5 March 2021



### Exercises

#### Debugging

1.Use `journalctl` on Linux or `log show` on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day. If there aren’t any you can execute some harmless commands such as `sudo ls` and check again.

   ```bash
   journalctl --since="1d ago" | grep
   ```

   

2.Do [this](https://github.com/spiside/pdb-tutorial) hands on `pdb` tutorial to familiarize yourself with the commands. For a more in depth tutorial read [this](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb).

 

3.Install [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically.

   ##### example code:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   ## Example: a typical script with several problems
   for f in $(ls *.m3u)
   do
     grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f \
       && echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
   done
   ```

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ## Example: a typical script with several problems
   for f in  ./*.m3u ;
   do
     grep -qi "hq.*mp3" "$f" \
       && echo -e "Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format"
   done
   ```

   

4.(Advanced) Read about [reversible debugging](https://undo.io/resources/reverse-debugging-whitepaper/) and get a simple example working using [`rr`](https://rr-project.org/) or [`RevPDB`](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/07/reverse-debugging-for-python.html).



#### Profiling

1.[Here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/static/files/sorts.py) are some sorting algorithm implementations. Use [`cProfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) and [`line_profiler`](https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler) to compare the runtime of insertion sort and quicksort. What is the bottleneck of each algorithm? Use then `memory_profiler` to check the memory consumption, why is insertion sort better? Check now the inplace version of quicksort. Challenge: Use `perf` to look at the cycle counts and cache hits and misses of each algorithm.

   ```bash
   #if kernprof cannot be found after installing line_profiler, the corresponding executable is probably be in ~/.local/bin/.
   ```

   

2.Here’s some (arguably convoluted) Python code for computing Fibonacci numbers using a function for each number.

   ```py
   #!/usr/bin/env python
   def fib0(): return 0
   
   def fib1(): return 1
   
   s = """def fib{}(): return fib{}() + fib{}()"""
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
   
       for n in range(2, 10):
           exec(s.format(n, n-1, n-2))
       # from functools import lru_cache
       # for n in range(10):
       #     exec("fib{} = lru_cache(1)(fib{})".format(n, n))
       print(eval("fib9()"))
   ```

   Put the code into a file and make it executable. Install prerequisites: [`pycallgraph`](http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/master/) and [`graphviz`](http://graphviz.org/). (If you can run `dot`, you already have GraphViz.) Run the code as is with `pycallgraph graphviz -- ./fib.py` and check the `pycallgraph.png` file. How many times is `fib0` called?. We can do better than that by memoizing the functions. Uncomment the commented lines and regenerate the images. How many times are we calling each `fibN` function now?

3.A common issue is that a port you want to listen on is already taken by another process. Let’s learn how to discover that process pid. First execute `python -m http.server 4444` to start a minimal web server listening on port `4444`. On a separate terminal run `lsof | grep LISTEN` to print all listening processes and ports. Find that process pid and terminate it by running `kill <PID>`.

4.Limiting processes resources can be another handy tool in your toolbox. Try running `stress -c 3` and visualize the CPU consumption with `htop`. Now, execute `taskset --cpu-list 0,2 stress -c 3` and visualize it. Is `stress` taking three CPUs? Why not? Read [`man taskset`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/taskset.1.html). Challenge: achieve the same using [`cgroups`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). Try limiting the memory consumption of `stress -m`.

5.(Advanced) The command `curl ipinfo.io` performs a HTTP request and fetches information about your public IP. Open [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and try to sniff the request and reply packets that `curl` sent and received. (Hint: Use the `http` filter to just watch HTTP packets).
